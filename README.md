# World Cup Football 2014

The world cup football has started recently in Brazil. Several national teams are competing for the world cup.
Players of all size and weights are giving their best performance on the pitch.

I leave it up to the coaches and supporters to determine whether the height and weight of their team's keepers, defenders, midfielders and attackers determine the chances to beat the opponents or not. 

In this simple application, the height and weight of the team's players are compared to these of their adversaries. 
The grey dots in the graph represent all players in the competition. The slope line indicates the linear regression between height and weight of the entire population.
The coloured dots represent the players of the national team of your choice. Goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders and attackers all have their own dot color.

Since I am from Belgium, since we had to wait 12 years to be present at the world cup and since, on average, and since we have the largest players, Belgium is the default country in the application.

Good luck!
